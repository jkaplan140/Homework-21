                    <p>Autism Improvised (AI), is a non-profit organization founded in Georgia. They use the power of
                        applied improv and theatre to help facilitate social communication skills and adaptive thinking
                        within people living with mild to moderate Autism. Using a two-pronged support system, AI places
                        an
                        emphasis on gaining transitional skills to prepare individuals for entry into the competitive
                        workforce, college, and adulthood in general.
                    </p>
                    <p>The primary goal of this project was to give a fantastic organization a vastly improved web
                        presence
                        and organizational structure, meant to alleviate pain points within the stakeholders as well as

                    <p>An average user, be them a primary care guardian, or self advocate must complete the same process
                        for
                        information gathering and program sign-ups. The user must go to autismimprovised.org, understand
                        the
                        organization, services provided, determine usefulness and applicability to
                        themselves,
                        discover potential programs, and contact the AI staff to learn more information as well as
                        "interview" to ensure best fit.

                    <p class="problem">Problem: </p>
                    <p>The current website does not have a structure or information architecture that
                        intuitively
                        provides the participant with necessary information or a full understanding of what the
                        organization
                        aims to accomplish.</p>
                    <p> To discover more information, the user must contact stakeholders by phone or email to register
                        and
                        participate. If either user or stakeholder decide the potential user is NOT a good fit, time is
                        wasted on behalf of both parties.</p>
                    <h2>Stakeholder Perspective:</h2>
                    <p>Stakeholders want to share their services and give every single person with higher-functioning
                        Autism
                        a safe landing space for self-exploration and interpersonal growth. They are a pioneer of social
                        communication training techniques and wish to expand to fit the needs of their community and
                        communities like them. </p>
                    <p class="problem">Problem:</p>
                    <p>The current system in place is a slow, arduous, and hands on approach at something that
                        could be automated. Stakeholders vocalized that they spend more time responding to emails and
                        answering calls than they do growing and developing their organization. </p>
                    <p>Because of this, donations slow down, fewer programs are offered, and there is not enough time to
                        develop new and potentially beneficial offerings.</p>

                        participate in what AI offers. There was a desperate need to convey how much passion the staff

                <p>Note: this is one portion of the project that we would have liked to improve upon. If we were to
                    complete this project again, or revisit it, we would love vto have more usability tests and A/B
                    testing to determine best fit for users and the organization.</p>

                <p>The project redesign was well received within the organization. Because the project timeline was
                    fairly short, we only had the time and bandwidth to produce ~5 pages for the organization as well as
                    a participant portal design. </p>
                <p>The current autismimprovised.org is powered by WIX and as such, the organization does not have the
                    freedom to use our designs as they are. As of writing this, no design changes have been made on the
                    original autismimprovised.org website. Our group is still in contact with the stakeholders of AI and
                    plan to work with them on a financially and technologically realistic redesign when our boot camp
                    program is concluded. </p>
                <p>As a result of our work with AI, the stakeholders have a direction in which they would like to take
                    their website. We believe that we gave them valuable insight into what their web presence could be,
                    and hope to help them complete their goal of expanding the reach of the organization and
                    streamlining the onboarding process for everyone involved.</p>
                <h3>What I learned:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaboration is key to producing a great product
                    </li>
                    <li>Reaching out, and staying in contact with stakeholders is an absolutely imperative process that
                        can drastically change the scope and goals of a project
                    </li>
                    <li>UI design is entirely dependent on the context in which you produce said designs. There is no
                        one right answer and everything from color patterns to drop shadows contribute to a flawless and
                        enjoyable experience. </li>
                    <li>Nothing should be overlooked</li>
